Data science is related to data mining, machine learning and big data ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science))\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data science is commonly defined as a methodology by which actionable insights can be inferred from data. Performing data science is a task with an objective: the production of beliefs informed by data and to be used as the basis of decision-making ([Introduction to Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Data-Science-Applications-Undergraduate/dp/3319500163)).\n",

    "- Predictive modelling uses statistics to predict outcomes. Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.\n",
    "In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of detection theory to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an email determining how likely that it is spam.([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_modelling))\n",
    "-Predictive modeling is the process of using known results to create, process, and validate a model that can be used to forecast future outcomes. It is a tool used in predictive analytics, a data mining technique that attempts to answer the question \"what might possibly happen in the future?\"([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/predictive-modeling.asp))\n",

    "- **Project 1**: ** Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder using Deep Learning **\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Project Summary**: Brain Imaging analysis is one of the emerging fields in the cognitive neuroscience. Imaging studies reveal insights about normal brain function and structure, neural processing and neuroanatomic manifestations of psychiatric and neurological disorders, and neural processing alterations associated with treatment response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most popular one among the several widely used imaging modalities. The advantage of fMRI is that it quantifies brain activity by measuring correlates of blood flow and metabolism. In particular, activation of the brain is associated with the localized increase in oxygen consumption. This leads to the oxygen rich blood flow towards the active area to meet the increased demand. The increased supply of oxygen outpaces the increased demand and leads to a relative increase in oxyhemoglobin and decrease in deoxyhemoglobin in activated brain areas. The typical form of fMRI works by leveraging magnetic susceptibility properties of hemoglobin in capillary red blood cells, which delivers oxygen to neurons. Since hemoglobin is diamagnetic when oxygenated and paramagnetic when deoxygenated, the MR scanner produces blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) signals that vary according to the degree of oxygenation. Due to this reason, fMRI can be used to create distributed maps of localized brain activity. In this project, we will analyze the resting state fMRI data of the two groups and create a network of connections between brain regions. We then develop a classification framework to distinguish the connectivity patterns between the autistic group and the normal group.\n",

    " - **Project 2**:  ** A Predictive Model for studying the Stock Market Volatility **\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Project Summary**:  Predicting stock price consists of complex non-linear relationships between various predictors. The classical time series models cannot accurately capture the non-linear relationship between the variables. On the other hand, Deep learning methods better explain the non-linear relationship than traditional methods. In this project, we work with time series data, such as the historical stock price, technical indicators data, etc., to develop a predictive model. A time series is a sequence of observations ordered with respect to time, such as monthly turnover, the daily prices of stocks, annual profits, and so on. The purpose of time series analysis consists of studying the past evolution of the phenomenon with respect to time to predict the phenomenon's future trend. Our analysis is based on the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model, a linear mathematical model that provides an output value based on the previous input and output values. Then we plan to implement GRU, a particular type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and conduct a comparison. Finally, we work on developing these models to predict the direction of movements of some common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n",

    " - **Project 3**:  ** An application of statistical network models **\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Project Summary**:  A network  G = (V, E) is a structure made of nodes V and edges E. The degree of a node represents the number of connections it has with other nodes in the network. Networks are more commonly expressed as graphs as well as in terms of matrices known as adjacency matrices. An adjacency matrix is a binary matrix where Aij = 1 if there is an edge connecting node i and node j, and Aij = 0 otherwise. Nodes in a network are often found to belong to groups or communities that exhibit similar behavior. In general, community structures may also refer to groups of vertices that connect in a similar manner to the rest of the nodes in a graph without necessarily having a higher inner density. The primary interest in such networks is to understand which nodes exhibit similar behavior and in what way. The latter serves as the preliminary step toward other learning tasks. Some of the applications of community detection in networks include understanding of sociological behavior, protein-to-protein interaction, gene expressions, recommendation systems, medical prognosis, image segmentation, natural language processing, product-customer segmentation, and web page sorting, to name a few. In this project, you will learn the idea of statistical network modeling. Furthermore, we will also explore its application to your field of interest.\n",

The framework's performance will be rigorously evaluated using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC.
